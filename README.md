# Overview

This project is a rudimentary inventory management system made in the Java programming language.
The program allows a user to add and delete named items with a specified quantity of said item.
User can then modify the amount of any item that has been entered as well as wipe everything or delete individual items.
Said items can be stored and loaded from an online Google Firestore NoSQL database.
